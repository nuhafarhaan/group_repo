<h1>My Tips for taking great photos!</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Always be aware of your lighting. You could be photographing the most interesting, beautiful thing ever seen by man, with a perfect composure, but if your lighting is off and you are getting flashbacks, glares, or unintended solar flares, it will essentially ruin the efficiency of your photo. If you are a photographer who will mainly be shooting objects or people indoors, away from natural light, then consider investing in  a softbox, as this gives the most evenly spread, glowing light. If you are a photographer who takes portraits, consider investing in a background loop light as this can create a beautiful, theatrical portrait. However, if you do not have the money, or do not wish to invest, natural light is always good, as long as you avoid shadowing your subject with the camera/you.</li>
    <li>If you are going to be taking photos in a medium to low light, or you will be using a long shutter speed, consider getting a tripod. Tripods are fantastic, and practically ensure a clean, crisp photograph with minimal blur. If you cannot get a tripod, or you simply do not want to, you can always use your surroundings to steady your camera. Things I have used before to have a crisp image include trees, walls and even the top of my friend’s head.</li>
    <li>Don’t be bound by limits. Take photos of whatever you wish to photograph- whatever captures your interest or what you are passionate about. The photos you take don’t have to be creative and interesting- you can just take photos to capture memories. Do whatever you want and don’t be bound by limits.</li>
    <li>You don’t need a DSLR or SLR camera to take good photos. Some of my best photos were taken using the camera on my iPhone 5 and then uploading them to Flickr. If your photo has clear focus, it doesn’t really matter too much about the quality of it.</li>
    <li>Take photos for yourself, and not others. What are you interested in, personally? Who are you inspired by? Take photos that you, if you were a viewer, would enjoy.</li>
    <li>Get criticism. Creative criticism is really important in learning how to improve your photographs. If you are aiming to become a professional photographer, this tip is especially important as other people, possibly more experienced in the very competitive photography industry.</li>
    <li>Join a photography network. Nowadays, the best ways to get your photographs ‘out there’ is by publishing them online. You can try and get attention, on Flickr, for example, by posting your photos to photography groups. On these groups, people can give you criticism and give you points on where to improve, alongside what they like about your work. These pointers are great foundations to starting to improve your photos.</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Good luck with your photography!</h2>
