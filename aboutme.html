      <h3 class="title">About Me</h3>
      <p>I am an anonymous photographer who was born in Kensington, London in May of 1999. The main features of my photos are the often opposing ideals between a life in the City, and everything that goes along with that, such as constant plethoras of traffic, sensory overload in our modern society bursting with media and usually prolonged atmosphere of stress, and the ideas of new- wave Romanticism and a life in the emerald of countryside. </p>
      <p>I truly hope that through my photos, I can push viewers to question their own ideals in a world where Neo- Nazism and the alt far right are rapidly rising, and consequently clashing with left- leaning views. </p>
      <p>To take my photos, I use both the camera on my phone, and my Olympus E510 camera, I take inspiration from the sublime juxtaposition of landscapes in and around metropolitan areas, such as the endless brick structures enriched in history of Westminster, the shimmering glass of Canary Wharf, the dewy green on Greenwich or the quiet streets of Belgravia.</p>
