    <div class="about-me">
      <p>I am an anonymous photographer who was born in Kensington, London in May of 1999. The main features of my photos are the often opposing ideals between a life in the City, and everything that goes along with that, such as constant plethoras of traffic, sensory overload in our modern society bursting with media and usually prolonged atmosphere of stress, and the ideas of new- wave Romanticism and a life in the emerald of countryside. </p>
