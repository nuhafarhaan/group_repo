      <h3 class="title">About Me</h3>
      <p>I am an anonymous photographer who was born in Kensington, London in May of 1999. The main features of my photos are the often opposing ideals between a life in the City, and everything that goes along with that, such as constant plethoras of traffic, sensory overload in our modern society bursting with media and usually prolonged atmosphere of stress, and the ideas of new- wave Romanticism and a life in the emerald of countryside. </p>
      <p>I truly hope that through my photos, I can push viewers to question their own ideals in a world where Neo- Nazism and the alt far right are rapidly rising, and consequently clashing with left- leaning views. </p>
      <p>To take my photos, I use both the camera on my phone, and my Olympus E510 camera, I take inspiration from the sublime juxtaposition of landscapes in and around metropolitan areas, such as the endless brick structures enriched in history of Westminster, the shimmering glass of Canary Wharf, the dewy green on Greenwich or the quiet streets of Belgravia.</p>

      <h3>My interview with the National Photography Organisation</h3>
      <h4>What influences you when taking your photos?</h4>
      <p>It’s the ideas of where I grew up. I grew up in a wealthy family in one of London’s richest boroughs, and due to that, my family never experienced any financial problems. I went to a very cushy private school, where no one ever really had any struggles, we were all mostly white, unaware of our privilege, with parents working in places such as Westminster, the Canary Wharf financial district or owning their own businesses. Our school had a swimming pool, huge tennis courts and fields, and was very well funded. And, due to our central location, there was never an end to the flowing opportunities- for many of my peers, after completing their A- levels, it was straight to university before getting a job in the City like their parents. We were all completely oblivious to the discrepancies in income and power between us, in Kensington, and more impoverished areas such as in the Tower Hamlets, or in the south- East of London, closer to Vauxhall or Battersea. When I finally overcame my ignorance, and recognised how lucky I was, I felt compelled to do something. Just because these areas have traditionally been regarded as poor, does not mean that they can’t change. I think that, in Britain attitudes to socioeconomic status are very unhealthy, and I want my photographs to reflect on that.
      </p>
      <h4>Why are you anonymous?</h4>
      <p>Like any photographer, I obviously want my work to be viewed, and known by the public- this is the only way the messages conveyed in my photos can actually reach the public, but I do not want to be known, or affiliated with my photos as they are not reflective on me, but on the city, and other places in the Britain, and the world.
      </p>
      <h4>How did you get into photography?</h4>
      <p>In the Christmas of 2010, my parents were so stuck with what to get me, that they bought a camera, despite me never showing an active interest in photography prior to that. At first, I was stuck with what to take photos of, which is ridiculous considering how I lived in one of the most culturally diverse and interesting cities in the world. After going out a few times with my camera, and getting my friends to pose in front of London’s landmarks for me, I finally discovered the genre of photos that I liked to take. I then started to go out more, and venture further out on the Tube to take photos. I started going more into the south of London, and trying to take thought- provoking photos. It was through this, I realised how immensely lucky I was to live where I do and have had the opportunities I received as a teenager. However, Tower Hamlets is an absolute luxury compared to the war zones in places such as the Congo, in central Africa, or Syria, where I hope to travel to in 2018. I don’t want to just read articles on these horrific disputes, I want to experience it myself, and try and further shine a light on the horrible treatment of these people; and the fact that they are people, and not death statistics on a Wikipedia page.
      </p>
      <h4>Do you retouch your photos?</h4>
      <p>Yes, like many photographers, I do retouch my photos. I do this because I think that it makes them far more interesting; however, I do think it can also look nice when photos are not edited at all as it provides a sense of authenticity to the photographer.
      </p>
      <h4>Do you make a living out of photography?</h4>
      <p>No, not at all. I only take photos because it is my passion. Whilst it would be lovely to make a living from my passion, I don’t think that it will happen any time soon. I have an almost full time job currently in an office working on upcoming technology projects- and I am excited for what the future holds in that aspect, so right now, even if I could make a living out of photography full time, I would not quit my job.
